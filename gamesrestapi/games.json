I enjoyed the game a lot more, to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together, but it still didn't quite enamour me like I'd wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen, often with them all acting completely independently. I have a huge amount of trouble processing all of that information, so oftentimes I found bosses just far too overwhelming. Not a design issue or anything, more of a personal one.\"]",

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but with REmake, RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasn't worth it because the story barely changed, but that's completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although that's also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way. This is easily my favorite RE game (at least until 4 Remake comes out) and one of my top 5 games of all time, so you better believe that I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.\", 'My entry point of the series (don’t ask) this remake of my first entry of the series and causing it to grow my love for the series in general this game is really really good and I had a fun time overall when playing this game and since I’m rating this out of pure nostalgia of Raccoon City and overall experience I think this game really deserves 5 stars but when playing this game I got really bad luck with its rng of Mr X and some Lickers since they actually keep killing me and at one point made a somewhat of a stun lock move so I have to take out half a star but it’s still worth playing since it is a very beautiful upgrade to the game I played as a kid and it’s as good as I remember', 'A really well done vision of what survival horror games could be and a great remake of this beloved classic in general.', 'I dont have much to say but I really like this game.

Por um lado é bom para recompensar a exploração mais minuciosa, mas por outro é muito anti-intuitivo.\\n                     \\n                     A atmosfera do jogo e a ambientação são ótimas, mas eu sinto que focou demais no terror, na opressão, às vezes até no grotesco e bizarro, e isso meio que me tira um pouco a diversão, tratando-se de um resident evil, onde uma das coisas que mais gosto é o gerenciamento de itens definir mais o combate que se você está nervoso com um inimigo que você não consegue enfrentar direito por ele ser muito resistente e ser um saco acertar na cabeça.\\n                     \\n                     No mais, acho um bom jogo, com bons personagens e com um rumo que não foi ruim pra franquia. Algumas coisas foram bons rascunhos pro próximo, então foi muito mérito a este game, apesar de eu não sentir um fator replay deste.']",

  "summary": "Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is the final game in the Metal Gear series. It is the sequel to Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes released the year before and a prequel to the original Metal Gear. The game has a complex story with long cut-scene sequences, but there are fewer and they are shorter compared to earlier Metal Gear Solid titles. Most of the gameplay mechanics introduced in Ground Zeroes are carried over: it is still an action game and stealth oriented but replaces the linear corridor design from most earlier titles with large open world environments that offer the player unrestricted freedom for the approach. The world has now a real-time day and night cycle and various weather effects that influence enemy behaviour, visibility and sound. Sabotaging or destroying certain structures can also influence other parts of the map.",
  "reviews": "['kojima i love you please have my children', 'Story will leave you with actual phantom pain but the gameplay is unmatched in the action stealth genre.', 'Preparing for missions and utilizing all the unique gear are the best parts of MGSV. The game does nothing to justify its open world structure though and adds unnecessary grinding for materials to upgrade your base which bogs down the gameplay.', \"It's hard to review this game. It has the best gameplay in the series, easily, but that's constantly interrupted by helicopter rides, visits to Mother Base, selecting your loadouts (even though, for me, it was the same loadout for almost every mission) and micromanaging your many recruits. Still, while you're actually in the field, the stealth gameplay feels excellent. But then it has the absolute worst story in the series. On the plus side... kinda... the vast majority of the story is on cassette tapes that are completely optional.\", 'Only 10-15 hours into this game and already it\\'s one of my favorites of all time. Let me illustrate why via some comparisons.\\n                     \\n                     Average Call of Duty mission: Walk in a straight line. Kill some people.\\n                     \\n                     Average F.E.A.R. mission: Walk in a straight line until you reach an arena where you will move around strategically and kill some people.\\n                     \\n                     Average Far Cry 3/4 mission: Drive across the world until you reach the location. Hide on a hill and snipe every bad guy at the base, then walk inside. Or sneak inside, I don\\'t care. This funnels you into a segment where you walk forward and kill people.\\n                     \\n                     Average MSGV mission: You have 15 minutes to destroy enemy vehicles. Their path is marked on your Pip Boy. Call in a supply drop for a grenade launcher up ahead, then ride on your horse to get ahead of a tank, pick up the grenade launcher, and ambush the tank. Next, ride across a bridge to the other side of a river, plant some C4, set up an ammo drop, go prone, and wait for another vehicle to pass by so you can blow it up. Next, you get a message that a Jeep is transporting a prisoner you need to extract. It\\'s across the river. User your sniper rifle to kill the driver and guard, run across the river, extract the prisoner, park the Jeep in the middle of the road so that it stops the next vehicle that is coming your way. Find a place to hide so you can ambush the vehicle. This is just the first half of the mission. And if you die, you can approach it a completely different way.\\n                     \\n                     This game feels like it takes Far Cry 4 and turns every gameplay element except for the open world up to 11. Instead of just shutting down the radios at a base, you can destroy their comms equipment, their anti-air radar, and their electrical power. Don\\'t just shut off the lights--shut off the lights, plant C4 on the power source, and then blow up the guy who comes by to turn the lights on.  But be careful, because the enemies will react to anything you do. Keep turning the lights off and they will start wearing night-vision goggles.\\n                     \\n                     The amount of things you can do in this game is amazing. Even though the game is relatively difficult (for me, anyway), it always feels fair. It\\'s always clear what killed me, and successfully completing a mission is less a matter of just getting better at doing a specific thing and more a matter of changing tactics. Enemy behavior is some of the most realistic and immersive I\\'ve seen in a stealth game. Sure, you can cheese the AI, but you really have to work for it, instead of just going round the corner so the enemies forget your presence. It really does feel like living through an awesome action movie rather than playing a video game.\\n                     \\n                     I only have a few complaints. One is that the open world really is empty; there\\'s nothing besides enemy bases. I wouldn\\'t so much call this an open world game as an open arena game or a semi-sandbox game or something equally clunky.  The goal of the open world in this game is not so much to simulate a living, breathing world (like Skyrim or Far Cry 4), but to give you a large area of operations for your missions. It succeeds in that regard, but I do wish there had been some more dynamic events happening. My other complaint is with the base management portion of the game--it feels like a mobile game, and takes away from the action. I want to be sneaking around and shooting stuff, not clicking through a menu.\\n                     \\n                     These are small complaints, however, and I can safely say that this game is one of the best games I have ever played. Since the game regularly goes on sale for a steep discount, I heartily recommend buying it.\\n                     \\n                     One more thing: you can put your own music into the game to play through your Pokedex or on the helicopter. There\\'s nothing quite as iconic as blasting through a base while \"Back in Black\" blares through the stereo, or having your chopper play \"Born in the USA\" every time it picks you up.', \"Release the Kojima's cut\"]",

I think the game definitely was missing a lot of aspects that are commonplace in the genre, but this was their first open-world game.

Generally speaking, I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth, like racing games, is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard, all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good, you\\'re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection.

Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book.\", 'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.', \"Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all.\", \"Honestly, there just wasn't enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's, even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring, the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming, I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome.\", \"The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game.\", 'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department, but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']",

  "summary": "Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (\"badniks\" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.\n             \n\n              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.\n             \n\n              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.\n             \n\n              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).\n             \n\n              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a \"Secret Zone\" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a \"goal block\" (which ends the level).",

  "reviews": "[\"I really enjoyed this one. The story is super interesting, most characters are multi-layered and more complex than they initially seem, and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius. As most reviews for this game have said, it's really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean you're now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases it's even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media.  I personally found myself more engrossed by the game's study of the main character, who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character, but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\\n                     \\n                     On that note, the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane, and they really don't feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character. Once again, this contributes heavily into making the player fit into the role-playing aspect of this game more, as their choices contribute to the type of cop they want to be.\", 'There is too much you could say about this game. Less of a \"game\", more of an interactive story with RPG elements - and the story is amazing.', \"some of the most human-feeling characters in games. it's well-written, well-acted, and generally very good. well worth a playthrough if it looks at all interesting.\", \"I really loved this game and how it able to make you feel like Harry through his inner voices.

Also a lack of party customization, which while it definitely saves time, is also one of my favorite aspects of Final Fantasy, so it is a bit sad to not feature it here... Also extremely slow battles, with camera panning taking forever. And Tetra Master is just an awful minigame and the fact that you need to win multiple games of it at one point in the story is abysmal... Chocobo Hot n' Cold is also awful.

  "summary": "Halo 3 is a shooter game where players primarily experience gameplay from a first-person perspective. Much of the gameplay takes place on foot, but also includes segments focused on vehicular combat. The balance of weapons and objects in the game was adjusted to better adhere to the \"Golden Triangle of Halo\": these are weapons, grenades, and melee attacks, which are available to a player in most situations. Players may dual-wield some weapons, forgoing the use of grenades and melee attacks in favor of the combined firepower of two weapons. Many weapons available in previous installments of the series return with minor cosmetic and power alterations. Unlike previous installments, the player's secondary weapon is visible on their player model, holstered or slung across the player's back.\n              \n              Halo 3 introduces \"support weapons\", which are cumbersome two-handed weapons that slow the player, but offer greatly increased firepower in return. In addition to weapons, the game contains a new class of gear called equipment; these items have various effects, ranging from defensive screens to shield regeneration and flares. Only one piece of equipment can be carried at a time. The game's vehicular component has been expanded with new drivable and AI-only vehicles.",

Putting it another way, these are fun big budget games and the treatment of them as a serious competitive format feels more like a sunk cost fallacy than an honest assessment of what these games are capable of.\", 'Halo 3 is how you conclude a trilogy. Similar to Halo 2, It keeps what works, improves upon that foundation, and built upon it and addresses certain criticisms.  Switching between Halo 2 Anniversary to Halo 3 is a tad jarring at first, but Halo 3 is still a beautiful game with amazing art direction.

O jogo resolve usar uma abordagem mais simples, com apenas uma arma e alguns tipos de munições que em suma maioria é utilizada de maneira pontual ao decorrer da jogatina. A gameplay simples e relativamente repetitiva não é um problema aqui, visto que o jogo possui um enredo rico em detalhes e que consegue desenvolver sua premissa com perfeição.

The puzzles were mostly fun but I just felt they lacked any independent themes. Usually, I can recall a few standout dungeons from each game but for this one, I can't say I can differentiate them and I just played it through over the last few days.\", \"Artistically, I love this game. The island setting is really refreshing and Koholint is so lovely to just exist in. The dreamlike nature of the narrative is super different for Zelda and the way it all wraps up at the end is so nice, finally meeting the Wind Fish, waking up, hearing Marin's song. Beautiful. And the visual style? Oh my god. I adore how this game looks so much, I want every game to look like this. It is so, so full of charm and colour and personality. Give me a Mario game that looks like this, give me a Pokemon game that looks like this, give me a fuckin GTA game that looks like this!! Genuinely what I would love more than anything else in the world is for the Zelda series - after Tears Of The Kingdom to come back to this style for the next mainline game. Don't just keep this relegated to remakes if you do Oracle Of Seasons & Ages, give me a full-on, original, top-down open-world game with this visual style.

  "reviews": "['In this first game, the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.', 'Sinceramente, eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho, mas, caramba, é torturante escalar, o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista, apesar de interessante, não tem quase nada de carisma, sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\\n                     \\n                     Para um início, mesmo levando em conta as limitações, ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão. Eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado a fazer para seguir com as principais, que são todas praticamente iguais e nada recompensadoras.', \"As someone who played Assassin's Creed back in the day, I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I appreciated the game's unique setting and storyline, which offered a fresh take on the action-adventure genre. The game's visuals were also impressive for their time, with richly detailed environments and realistic character animations.\", 'Weird nostalgia for this one. I remember my dad used to laugh when I mowed the pilgrims over with my horse.', \"(Played before 2023)\\n                     \\n                     I played this when I was younger a lot, and I am pretty sure the first YouTube video I ever did was recording me diving into some hay as a child. I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there could've been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming. Overall, a fantastic game and I think it has actually aged very well, especially the parkour. It is also one of the best looking, early-era PS3 games on the console which should also be mentioned.\", 'nostalgia bias: it was a good game']",

  "summary": "Shovel Knight is a sweeping classic action adventure game with awesome gameplay, memorable characters, and an 8-bit retro aesthetic. It's a hot mashup of new and old! You play as the eponymous Shovel Knight, a small knight with a huge quest. Shovel Knight has come to this land with two goals: to defeat the evil Enchantress and quest for his lost beloved. He wields a Shovel Blade: a multipurpose weapon whose techniques have now been lost to the ages. Always honest and helpful, Shovel Knight is a shining example of the code of Shovelry: Slash Mercilessly and Dig Tirelessly!\n             \n\n              But, between Shovel Knight and his beloved stands a cadre of villainous knights. These terrible foes, known as The Order of No Quarter, have been dispatched to prevent Shovel Knight from reaching the Enchantress, and will pursue their mission at any cost. If you love games with perfect platforming, beautiful art, infectious music, crazy bosses, humor and levity, and real heart… Shovel Knight is for you!",
  "reviews": "['My status:', \"You'll love this game if you grew up on NES/SNES games. You'll also probably like it if you just like action platformers in general. Really solid game, also it is not a metroidvania if thats what anyone is looking for.\", \"This game is the poster child for 8-bit throwback games, and with good reason. It basically captures the NES era of games the best it possibly can while also bringing it up to date with modern design conventions. It's basically the gold standard for those kinds of games, so if you fancy yourself a nice 2D platformer and want a solidly good 8-bit throwback, this is your game. Theres also a ton of free bonus campaigns in this game but I still haven't played those yet, should get around to doing that someday.\", 'Shovel Knight era pra ser tudo de bom, né? Eu entendo. Eu adoro o universo, as músicas, o visual... mas não é meu tipo de jogo. Tem pouco espaço pra exploração, tem uns desafios de plataforma que não são pra mim E TEM CORPSE RUN CLUBE DE IATE PORQUE VOCÊ FEZ ISSO', \"Shovel Knight seriously rocks. What really shines is the level design, soundtrack, and main mechanic of bouncing with the shovel. The death defying jumps make the game stressful, but it doesn't make it too challenging. I would give this one a try if you like 2D platformers, it seriously is a classic.\", 'Here’s a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3D era because of their lack of availability, or because their foundation is comparatively primitive, and therefore jarringly inaccessible? The reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault, for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon, fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it’s because I spend too much time on the internet, but I’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games, on the other hand, are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly, as someone born in the early 3D era, many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites, as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely, there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era, and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen, whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent, games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight, a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.']",

Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies. Various new power-ups are introduced in this title, with the trademark suit being the Cat power-up, which enables characters to perform a melee attack, climb up walls, and leap while midair, as well as the game generally having a cat-based theme.",

  "summary": "Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney − Trials and Tribulations (known as Gyakuten Saiaban 3 in Japan) is the third game in the Ace Attorney series. Players take on the role of Phoenix Wright, a defense attorney known for taking on seemingly impossible cases. While the game focuses on a few specific cases, the overarching story of the Phoenix Wright franchise spans the length of the series, involving obscure characters from large families and intricate webs of lies, plots, and murder. The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.",

Walking through a door and getting insta-headshot three times and then the fourth time doing the same thing and not having it happen got annoying, and supposedly there is a major bug that makes it so the difficulty slider, which is tied to the only difficulty you can play at the start, is broken and doesn't properly balance the game. As well, some aspects feel a little too gamey in this serious tale, with a few levels sticking out like a sore thumb (the underground level). I feel enemy variety wasn't really a thing, just the same enemy that got stronger and stronger.

As with many Square Enix games, they always deliver when it comes to music & overall aesthetics, especially when compared to KH1 & other Final Fantasy titles. The gameplay is greatly improved upon over Kingdom Hearts 1 in almost every regard: camera, movement, combat, platforming; everything that was good is better and everything that was bad is pretty much fixed. With that being said, this is where the story begins to take a nosedive in every direction. I personally skip all the cutscenses just to enjoy gameplay, which while great is very slow to pickup in the beginning due to the Roxas portion of the game. Without skipping cutscenes, it's going to take a long time for the gameplay to come together into something really enjoyable.\", \"In my review of KH1 I remarked on how if I played these games as a kid they would have totally been my absolute favorites, mostly due to how the game had a sort of magical sense to it seeing as it was a Disney title. This game felt like it had a better fusion of both the whimsical magic that makes Disney titles shine as well as the more edgy anime-ass vibes that Square Enix was known for. Combined, those two elements make for a game that I feel if I had played as a kid, it would have changed things the same way Sonic Adventure 2 did for me. That right there is a powerful energy that I can only really say belongs to these two games and these two games alone. Unfortunately, I played this a little too late for it to have that kind of impact on me personally, but I absolutely recognize that power when I see it. The game pretty much improves upon the first in every way, with better locales, fancier and flashier gameplay, a more intricate plot, the whole nine yards. My only major gripe that I have with it is I think the second half could have been streamlined a bit better, and they could have made both acts for each world happen in a row rather than having you go through every world twice. Outside of that, this is a particularly special game. Which is certainly something I never thought I'd say about a mfin game where a bunch of edgy cloaked dudes and mickey mouse share the same screen space.\", 'This game is extremely nostalgic for me, I can still see myself turning on the ps2 and playing the og game.

I\\'m glad that the game actually found a final version, and wasn\\'t just a concept with nothing done with it! As for the actual game itself, it was neat. I liked how they focused a lot on perspective based puzzles not only with the main gimmick of resizing objects based on perspective, but also with things like lighting and making 2D objects 3D, and resizing yourself to solve puzzles. However, there definitely were a lot of points where you are just walking through hallways, which felt like padding. It seems like while the game concept was really cool, there really wasn\\'t a lot you could properly do to put those cool mechanics into practice to make the game \"the next portal\" like everyone thought it would be when it was shown off. That being said, Portal is a really high bar, so not reaching that expectation does not a bad game make, since this game is still definitely worth playing IMO.

I\\'m not one of the best or brightest and so having puzzles centered around one \"thing\" like portals or in this case, perspective, means that it\\'s not too difficult to figure out what you may want to do. Each puzzle is really cool obviously, the use of perspective to fiddle with objects is trippy and fun to just mess with. My personal favorite part of the game was the level design and the way it made you feel like you were spiraling ever deeper in a dream. From the endlessly carpeted halls of a hotel to spooky dimly lit backrooms I was on the edge of my seat on this ride. At the very climax of the game, when you have been spiraling ever deeper trapped in this dream, the entire thing is kind of thrown away.

Released just 2 years after the decidedly grim Persona 3, and on the same engine, P4 delivers an overall joyful and optimistic tone that helped it stand out not only from its predecessor, but from previous Persona and SMT games as well. This may seem counter-intuitive, as the focus of the story is on finding a murder suspect who kills 2 people within hours of the game's beginning. Yet it's the moment-to-moment dialogue, the soundtrack, even the color palette (the yellow theme provides an overall sunny disposition) that makes Persona 4 not only a joyful experience, but a joy to experience.\"]",

None of the characters were very interesting, but my least favorite was easily the protagonist, because on top of the obviously bad idea of making him be part of a fictional Native American tribe, Delsin Rowe was also just annoying, as his constant quips and one-liners consistently got on my nerves.\", \"This game is what validated my PS4 back when it came out. Visually it still looks great with a lot of good lighting and particle effects. Either that or I'm still just easy to please. The plot is pretty cool too, as you play as some rebel dude tryin to overthrow the authority with his elemental powers. As your character can steal elemental powers from other people, there's a lot of different abilities you can use and can switch from element to element on the fly so that's cool. There are also moments where you hold the dualshock 4 controller sideways like a spray can to paint stuff and that goes hard I love dumb controller gimmicks. I had a good time with this one.\", 'Any game with a protagonist that can shoot stuff out of his hands and is voiced by Troy Baker is getting a good score from me.

I beat this edition and played through most of the original as a kid, and I can say I never had strong memories about it aside from a few rooms. Beating it now after coming from other Kirby games, the game is plainly dated and I found myself rushing to just beat it after a while.\\n                     \\n                     The presentation is cute, the hybrid artstyle and cutscenes are nice to see, but as far as gameplay goes, SSU doesn\\'t do too much to add from the original — which I definitely have qualms over.\\n                     \\n                     Air movement is very sad in this game. Previous entries weren\\'t that great in this either, but it feels extremely noticable here. Jumps are not as pronounced (wheel still did not have this at the time, but felt like it could\\'ve been included),  flying (a major trait of Kirby) feels like such a pain in the ass that it\\'s better to avoid it over ground movement where possible, and many of the levels contain claustrophobic designs, sometimes cram-packed with enemies on top of hazard spam (either with lava or electricity as the main suspects) which all started to blur into one another instead of giving each place an overly distinct identity (aside from stages that were a 1-off gimmick). The worst part about this is that the amount of sources that inflict Heavy Knockdown to Kirby is very grinding, which only made me want to play more impatiently and roll my eyes when trying to brush away from a hazard ends up making you waste a few seconds, killing the pacing and action often. I assume the levels were left untouched from SS, but I feel like improvements could have been made to (at least) the level design. One-gap holes you must fall into, mazes galore and some other unintuitive puzzles (specific lava being passable when the rest isn\\'t) drowned my joy out.\\n                     \\n                     I don\\'t have much to say about the rest, everyone loves Marx and Galacta Knight.

I personally prefer a centralized thing, and each segment didn\\'t make me feel like replaying it. I understand why they went this route, though.\\n                     \\n                     There is no bad Kirby game, and if managed to 97% the game then it was partially fun enough, but I have to give it my personal \"OK\" rating that made it a bit below Squeak Squad. Other games have more to offer and feel better to play, and all the \"hip and cool\" concepts of this game are mostly at the end of one\\'s playthrough to postpone playing it (if you\\'re not playing Kirbies in order).

Everything that made the original game great is enhanced here, in addition to this game having several brand new modes after Milky Way Wishes.

Clearing the true arena in this game was a massive accomplishment for anyone in my friend group who could survive the final 4 gauntlet.

At first, the prince can only pick up smaller items, but as the Katamari grows, the more it can collect. Push pins and paper clips cling to the Katamari increasing its size so it can roll over obstacles and pick up bigger items. Over many levels, the Katamari can eventually pick up people, cars, and other bigger items.\n             \n\n              Players steer the Katamari from a third-person perspective using the analog sticks on the PS2. A tutorial stage takes the player through the controls and sets up the story as well as introducing a side story about a Japanese girl who can feel the cosmos. Wanting to challenge the prince, the King sets requirements on the Katamari’s size and sets time limits on the level. Bonus missions restore constellations and have their own restrictions.\n             \n\n              The world of Katamari Damacy is brought to life with off-beat animation and a catchy soundtrack.

Porém mesmo sendo um game muito gostoso de jogar , os inimigos não acompanham essa fluidez toda e acabam sendo na esmagadora maioria do jogo apenas sacos de pancadas de combos, o que abaixa e muito a dificuldade do game, o que pode desagradar alguns ( incluindo eu).

In this sweeping dungeon-crawling epic you play as Ashley Riot, a young assassin and spy for the organization known as Riskbreakers. Your goal is to unravel a deep and twisted plot and come to terms with the recent death of your wife and child. If this sounds a bit too cerebral never fear. Your path to recapturing your sense of humanity hinges on the destruction of countless vicious monsters and the exploration of dark and dangerous dungeons. Vagrant Story is awash in gorgeous scenery and features designs from Yasumi Matsuno and Akihiko Yoshida, the acclaimed artists and creators behind Final Fantasy Tactics.",

They dabbled in the action RPG subgenre before, but with the release of Vagrant Story in 2000, the \"action\" aspect was amplified, and the RPG aspect was significantly toned down. Players expecting a similar experience to previously mentioned games would be in for a big surprise, as this title lacked all the tropes you would expect in a typical RPG; no levels, no parties, no item shops, no grinding. Vagrant Story\\'s main appeal, at the time and currently, is its diversion from the norm of what RPGs were expected to be. It\\'s no doubt that VS offers quite the unique experience; whether that\\'s a good thing or not, though, is up for debate.']",

I enjoyed the game a lot more, to the point where I was the one pushing us to do the DLC together, but it still didn't quite enamour me like I'd wanted it to. My main complaint at the time was the design of some of the bosses. I felt that a lot of them relied on being able to pay attention to cues and bullets coming from multiple parts of the screen, often with them all acting completely independently.

Don't get me wrong, it's a great game, but with REmake, RE3 and Code Veronica it was for me the weakest in the classic style saga. Then came this game in 2019. Holy fuck. Not only was this the first RE game I played on launch, but it just blew me away with how polished it was. The police station feels more real than ever, with dark and immersive areas that make you feel trapped and scared. The graphics also contribute to this, being incredibly realistic yet stylized, even if spme faces look a bit weird. I complained about how in the original RE playing as both characters wasn't worth it because the story barely changed, but that's completely fixed here. Not only do each of them have compelling and really different stories, but they also have different accessible rooms, gameplay segments and even final bosses. Another recurring problem with this franchise is that the best area is always the first one, and although that's also the case here, both the sewers and the lab are really fun and memorable in their own way. This is easily my favorite RE game (at least until 4 Remake comes out) and one of my top 5 games of all time, so you better believe that I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone.\", 'My entry point of the series (don’t ask) this remake of my first entry of the series and causing it to grow my love for the series in general this game is really really good and I had a fun time overall when playing this game and since I’m rating this out of pure nostalgia of Raccoon City and overall experience I think this game really deserves 5 stars but when playing this game I got really bad luck with its rng of Mr X and some Lickers since they actually keep killing me and at one point made a somewhat of a stun lock move so I have to take out half a star but it’s still worth playing since it is a very beautiful upgrade to the game I played as a kid and it’s as good as I remember', 'A really well done vision of what survival horror games could be and a great remake of this beloved classic in general.', 'I dont have much to say but I really like this game.

This game is a really cool time capsule of not only by playing into the iconic gameplay style of the time ( the Konami Ninja Turtle arcade games), but it perseveres most of the original voice actors, art style, referances and characters. The game almost can feel like a crash course to somebody like me who doesnt know much about the series, which I really apreciate. There are some really good tracks in this, most of which were composed by the Sonic Mania composer. The physical edition even came with a Pizza Hut coupon for a free personal pan pizza, which is incredible (I ate pizza pretty much every time I played this game).

Assassin's Creed wishes it could do this.\", 'Dishonored\\n                     \\n                     is one of the few games I\\'ve ever played where a direct recommendation of \"play this with a controller/keyboard and mouse\" cannot be made. Generally speaking, I enjoy playing stealth games with a controller. Stealth, like racing games, is a genre that benefits greatly from analog sticks. At the heart of a great stealth game is nail-biting tension and suspense. Vulnerability is stressed through risk outweighing reward. On a keyboard, all of your inputs are static. Are you pressing up? Good, you\\'re moving up. Jolting an analog stick up can mean the difference between shuffling silently and bringing in nearby ears for inspection. Even in games where this choice tends to be an illusion, it heightens the already high stakes of weaving in and out of crowded spaces as little more than a specter in the night. If that\\'s how you choose to play\\n                     \\n                      Dishonored\\n                     \\n                     , I recommend it. Leaning and inventory management can feel a little less natural than they would on a keyboard, but they\\'re functional and aren\\'t as distracting as they could potentially be. In the words of Godd Howard himself, \"it just works.\"', 'They tried so hard... and got so far. But in the end, it falls short in a lot of ways.', 'Fun first person stealth game! Mechanics are satisfying and story is interesting. The AI can act very strangely at times which can be frustrating. Apart from this, I really enjoyed this game.', \"A really good immersive sim with a focus on high-tier stealth gameplay. I really enjoyed both playthroughs, but I really felt the good and bad hasn't aged as well. I wish it was more morally ambiguous, because it is weird a game about assassination technically punishes you for, well, assassinating someone. The world was decent as well but I felt like it was lacking in some aspects, and we are told a lot more about things than shown about the city's history and politics.\", 'This might be a superb game– bordering on perfect– but there were elements in my playthrough that marred the experience.']",

Live a Live is a must play for anyone who enjoys Square's Super Nintendo output or anyone who wants a JRPG that doesn't play by the book.\", 'This is a collection of a bunch of vignettes that all play with JRPG tropes in unique ways, and for the most part I found these stories really unique and entertaining. This feels like the predecessor to Chrono Trigger in many ways, so fans of that game will immediately see similarities. It’s mostly a very accessible game, but my one big fault is that the game lets you choose any of these chapters to start with. Certain chapters I enjoyed within the context of the rest of the game, but are particularly unconventional and could make for a very weak first impression. Aside from that tho, I honestly loved this. Combat is a big standout for me, each encounter was like a mini tactics battle with a really fun grid system. I had to thoughtfully consider how to dispatch enemies effectively, and while it’s far from a difficult game, each battle had me engaged. Presentation is gorgeous with the HD-2D Switch remake, it’s a total overhaul that still remains faithful to the original. While some chapters are definitely weaker than others, I thoroughly enjoyed the majority of my time with this game. And while I won’t spoil the final segments that come after you finish the seven main chapters, I found them to be so fun and satisfying that they elevate the entire experience. This definitely deserves to be considered a classic of the era right alongside FFVI and Chrono Trigger.', \"Such a creative and imaginative RPG from start to finish that I'd honestly place it among my favorites. The amount of love pumped into this remake is brimming and hard to not smile at. The battle system was fun to get ahold of and the characters were all charming to see regardless of how simple they may come off as to people (it was a bit of a blueprint for omnibus storytelling after all.\", \"Honestly, there just wasn't enough here to keep me engaged. Most of the chapters don't encourage exploration, the combat is lackluster with little to no skill involved, and the characters are underwhelming on the whole with very little emotional impact. The space episode was the best one that I got to, and even that had me rolling my eyes at some points. I expect more from RPG's, even remasters of old classics. If the combat is boring, the story had better be engaging. If the story is underwhelming, I want to be excited for each battle. Neither of these is the case for this game. It truly overstayed its welcome.\", \"The best soundtrack I've ever heard in a video game.\", 'Rough around the edges in the gameplay department, but ultimately a compelling and well-written story about how the many forms a hero can take and the choices they make that get them there.']",

  "summary": "Sonic the Hedgehog is a 2D, side-scrolling platformer, whose gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels incorporating springs, slopes, high falls, and loop-the-loops. The levels contain hazards in the form of robots (\"badniks\" in the Western game manuals) in which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals. Although destroying a robot frees the animal within, this is not required to complete the game. The player must avoid rows of sharp spikes, falling into bottomless pits, being crushed by moving walls or platforms, and drowning (which can be avoided by breathing air bubbles periodically released from vents). Sonic's main attack is his spin, where he curls into a ball and rotates rapidly (damaging enemies and some obstacles). This can be performed by jumping in the air or rolling on the ground.\n             \n\n              Scattered around each level map are gold rings and collecting 100 rings rewards the player with an extra life. Rings are a layer of protection against hazards; if Sonic has at least one ring when he collides with an enemy, he will survive. However, all his rings will be scattered; they will flicker and disappear in a few seconds if they are not picked up again. If Sonic is hit without any rings, he loses a life. Although shields and temporary invincibility may be collected to provide additional protection, certain hazards (such as drowning, being crushed, falling down a bottomless pit or running out of time) will cost Sonic a life regardless of rings or other protection.\n             \n\n              The game is divided into six zones (Green Hill, Marble, Spring Yard, Labyrinth, Star Light, and Scrap Brain), each with its own visual style and enemies. A player must navigate through each zone (subdivided into three acts) to progress.\n             \n\n              At the end of each zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik (who pilots a different vehicle each time) in a boss fight. After the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the Final Zone for a last encounter with Robotnik. They begin with three lives (power-ups and rings add more), which are lost when Sonic collides with hazardous enemies (or objects) without rings, falls off-screen or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit. Lampposts acting as checkpoints allow Sonic to return to the most-recently activated post when he loses a life. If he loses a life as a result of time running out but has another life, the timer will reset to 0:00 when he returns to the checkpoint. If all lives are lost at any point in the game, the game over screen will appear (when the player can return to the beginning of the act with three lives, if they have any continues).\n             \n\n              When Sonic reaches the end of act one or act two of a zone with at least fifty rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a Special Stage (a \"Secret Zone\" in the original Genesis manual). In each of six Special Stages, Sonic bounces off the bumpers and walls of a rotating maze in spin attack. Although the player earns a continue with each 50 rings found, their main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald at the end of the maze without colliding with a \"goal block\" (which ends the level).",

  "reviews": "[\"I really enjoyed this one. The story is super interesting, most characters are multi-layered and more complex than they initially seem, and how this game handles skills and thoughts is genius. As most reviews for this game have said, it's really great that failing a skill check does not necessarily mean you're now going through a worse version of the game (in some cases it's even a more fun route). The politics and wordbuilding are also super deep and will really please those who enjoy those topics in their media.  I personally found myself more engrossed by the game's study of the main character, who was as awful and destructive as he was likeable and relatable. I also found it incredible how the writers have managed to give him his own personality while also allowing a huge amount of his character to be determined by the player. Normally games tend to present one of these two archetypes for their main character, but this mixture of both helps a lot in giving the player a much deeper connection with the character while also allowing the character to serve the main themes of the story.\\n                     \\n                     On that note, the amount of choices they give you for customizing him are insane, and they really don't feel overwhelming despite there being multiple methods to change your character. Once again, this contributes heavily into making the player fit into the role-playing aspect of this game more, as their choices contribute to the type of cop they want to be.\", 'There is too much you could say about this game.

  "reviews": "['O Altair parece um mitra do Cerco, mas de resto gostei muito do drogado', 'In this first game, the story and switching between present day (circa 2007) and the past set in the Crusade era Holy Land is such an intriguing premise and the authenticity of the world and character design can be admired. That isn’t to say the game is the worst thing ever, but it truly is soooooooo tedious and repetitive that it’s tough to recommend. The parkour system is very cool and has a lot of attention to detail put into the running and climbing animations. Scaling towers and doing Leaps of Faiths is so fun which somewhat makes up for the overabundance of sync points. There are many other menial side missions that, while not lacking in variety, are just copy and pasted everywhere and it gets tiring very quickly. Play it if you’re curious as some of the stealth is fun (and a little more low key compared to later entires in the series), but don’t be surprised if it gets dull very quickly.', 'Sinceramente, eu não curti. Sei que é o primeiro jogo e que as mecânicas ainda eram um rascunho, mas, caramba, é torturante escalar, o combate não tem diversidade nenhuma e o protagonista, apesar de interessante, não tem quase nada de carisma, sempre falando em tom neutro e sem expressar emoção.\\n                     \\n                     Para um início, mesmo levando em conta as limitações, ainda é bem fraco. É só ver que Prince of Persia fez mecânicas muito mais agradáveis, e que este deveria ser uma evolução pelo menos das escaladas, mas não é o que acontece. Basicamente o jogo não tem stealth, e isso matou a graça de muitas missões, pois você basicamente chega no inimigo e esfaqueia, depois aperta o botão para disfarçar. Me vi muitas vezes frustrado por ter de fazer missões repetitivas de assassinato onde tinham 3 alvos e se eu falhasse, ficava mais difícil porque os corpos dos que eu matei ainda estavam lá e os guardas ficavam em alerta, dificultando conseguir assassinar o alvo sem falhar, e as vezes os npcs (os loucos), simplesmente me empurravam, eu esbarrava em um guardsne falhava a missão. Eu tive 0 vontade de fazer qualquer side quest que não fosse obrigado a fazer para seguir com as principais, que são todas praticamente iguais e nada recompensadoras.', \"As someone who played Assassin's Creed back in the day, I have to say that I had mixed feelings about it. On the one hand, I appreciated the game's unique setting and storyline, which offered a fresh take on the action-adventure genre. The game's visuals were also impressive for their time, with richly detailed environments and realistic character animations.\", 'Weird nostalgia for this one. I remember my dad used to laugh when I mowed the pilgrims over with my horse.', \"(Played before 2023)\\n                     \\n                     I played this when I was younger a lot, and I am pretty sure the first YouTube video I ever did was recording me diving into some hay as a child. I then played it again more recently, a couple of years ago to re-experience it and I love it. Ezio is the golden child of the series but Altair truly embodies the assassin in my mind infinitely better. Cold, calculating while still maintaining his humanity and code. I loved the city, running around and exploring while fighting enemies, but you definitely felt like there could've been more tools to use in the game. I also really liked the Desmond sections, they had juuuussst enough mystery to them without being overwhelming. Overall, a fantastic game and I think it has actually aged very well, especially the parkour. It is also one of the best looking, early-era PS3 games on the console which should also be mentioned.\"]",

What really shines is the level design, soundtrack, and main mechanic of bouncing with the shovel. The death defying jumps make the game stressful, but it doesn't make it too challenging. I would give this one a try if you like 2D platformers, it seriously is a classic.\", 'Here’s a pressing question for all you gamers under the age of thirty: do you actively avoid playing games from the pre-3D era because of their lack of availability, or because their foundation is comparatively primitive, and therefore jarringly inaccessible? The reason can’t be because these games are locked in an archival vault, for they are commonly ported to modern platforms. It must be due to the prevailing notion that video games have an arbitrary expiration date. C’mon, fess up. I’m not saying everyone born after the early 90s shares these predilections, but there seems to be a widespread viewpoint among younger gamers that vilifies games that predate their own conception, especially those of the early pixelated 2D period released before the late 1990s. A sneering distaste for the classics isn’t as pervasive with films or music. Zoomers will attend theater screenings of 2001: A Space Odyssey high as a kite and emphatically detail their “transcendental experience” to their peers with a Pulp Fiction poster in the background of their dorm rooms. No one is delusional enough to place the prequels or Disney Star Wars films over the immortal original trilogy regardless of their age. Maybe it’s because I spend too much time on the internet, but I’ve noticed that discovering older music artists via the world wide web is a more common practice among teenagers now than it was when I was in high school. Older video games, on the other hand, are treated with the same reaction of revulsion as if they were being forced to eat their brussels sprouts. Admittedly, as someone born in the early 3D era, many of the industry practices and comparatively primitive facets of game design can verge on being excruciating. I can count merely a handful of games that were released before I was born that are among my personal favorites, as there is only so much pain I can handle before my spirit shatters and I am in dire need of a relaxing bath with some chocolate ice cream for comfort. Conversely, there are plenty of those whose gaming prime was this jagged era, and the shift to 3D left them bewildered. They’ve assigned themselves to the role of gaming elder statesmen, whose repertoire is cryogenically frozen to the time before the medium became polygonal. After a certain point where the gaming industry reached a point of proficiency with 3D visuals to an almost cinematic extent, games that resembled those of the primeval pixelated years started popping out of the indie woodwork. One of the first breakout titles in this new wave of old-school revival games was Shovel Knight, a 2D side scroller that arguably bridged the generational gap of gamers.']",

Players can select their character from a pool of playable characters prior to starting the game, and each of these characters have their own unique playstyle that gives them advantages and disadvantages over other characters. The game makes use of several Wii U exclusive features, such as tapping blocks with the touch screen on the GamePad and blowing into the mic to reveal hidden items and blow away enemies.

The nature of the series remains generally lighthearted, something that's reinforced by its playful, anime-inspired visual style, but the nature of the crimes committed can be cold and downright disturbing. While the game's legal acumen is highly dubious, its aim seems to be more about producing comedic or stereotypically dramatic courtroom moments. Ace Attorney 3 makes light use of the DS touch screen, allowing the player to examine crime scenes and inspect evidence and character profiles. The top screen is used more for storytelling purposes, displaying various dialogue and conversations between characters. During these sequences the lower screen becomes a selection menu, displaying a series of questions to ask witnesses and further your investigation in search of evidence to use in defense of your client in each chapter.",

Walking through a door and getting insta-headshot three times and then the fourth time doing the same thing and not having it happen got annoying, and supposedly there is a major bug that makes it so the difficulty slider, which is tied to the only difficulty you can play at the start, is broken and doesn't properly balance the game.

If something isn't right- namely if Freddybear or his friends aren't in their proper places, you must find them on the monitors and protect yourself if needed!\n             \n\n              Can you survive five nights at Freddy's?",
